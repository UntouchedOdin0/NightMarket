# Configuration for currency implementations. Use this with external dependencies to add their currency managers in.
currencies:

# Configuration for the data store used to store players' current shop rotation. Remote databases are supported for cross-server night markets.
# > Types:
#   - Remote Databases: (You will need to use one of these for cross-server night markets!)
#       => MySQL (remote relation-based database, may have connection/lag issues)
#
#       => MongoDB (remote document-based database, may have connection/lag issues)
#
#   - Local Databases: (These will only store player night markets on the current server!)
#       => JSON (human-readable text format, prone to corruption and error)
#
#       => SQLite (flatfile relation-based database that lives in the plugins' folder, fast and stable)
#
datastore:
  type: "SQLite"
  # Only required if type is set to MySQL!
  mysql:
    user: "root"
    password: "password"
    host: "localhost"
    port: 3306
    database: "NightMarket"
  # Only required if type is set to MongoDB!
  mongo:
    uri: "mongodb://username:password@host:port"
    database: "NightMarket"

# Configuration for other miscellaneous settings.
other:
  # Should the GUI close after buying an item?
  close_on_buy: true
  # Should an announcement be sent when shops have rotated?
  rotate_announcement: true
  # Should NightMarket check SpigotMC daily for updates?
  update: true
